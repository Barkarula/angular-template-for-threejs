this Git repository:\n- Simplify new web project development with Angular and modern 3D engine Three.js\n- This template project can be quickly used as base instead of wasting hours of going through building instructions\n- SceneComponent with basic usage of scene, camera, lights, axis helper, raytracer, renderer and OBJ/MTL model\n- Demonstrated three.js examples (eg OrbitControls, ObjLoader. MtlLoader).\nDemo\nClick below to see demo in Web browser:\n\nUsage\nClone Repository\ngit clone https://github.com/makimenko/angular-template-for-threejs.git\ncd angular-template-for-threejs\nInstall Dependencies\nnpm install\nBuild and Run\nng serve --open\nAPI Documentation\nFor mode details see API documentation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         result-matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2017 Mihail Akimenko\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
