in this file.\nThe format is based on Keep a Changelog,\nand this project adheres to Semantic Versioning.\n[Unreleased]\nChanged\n\nDeprecate ObjLoaderComponent's texturePath input attribute in favor of resourcePath (following Three.js' lead in this commit).\nFrom now on use )\n\n[1.1.0] - 2019-09-27\nAdded\n\nInteractivity features:\nRaycasterService - allows to find objects intersections on mouse move/down. Emit object event.\nDirectives: atft-raycaster-camera, atft-raycaster-enable, atft-raycaster-group\n\n\nPerformance optimizations:\nRendererService - is responsible for the scene rendering. By default injected into all objects.\natft-raycaster-group - allows to group multiple hierarchical objects and emit event only on parent object (where directive is defined)\n\n\nAnimation features:\nAnimationService - is responsible for the animation frame preparation (emit animation event to all objects) and as last step - request rendering (emit render event for RendererService)\n\n\nData Center Actor module\nMultiple new demo stories in storybook\n\nInstall from NPM: https://www.npmjs.com/package/atft\n\n[1.0.2] - 2019-09-07\nAdded\n\nIntegrate Storybook.js for isolated component exploration and development\nNew demo scenes\nNew components for\nshadow\ndirect light\nconnector\nplane\nbox meshesChanged\n\n\n\nSwitch from Angular directives to components\nNew abstractions\n\n[0.1.0] - 2019-04-18\nSame as [0.0.3], see [0.0.3] for the reasons it was yanked.\n[0.0.3] - 2019-04-18 [YANKED]\nYanked due to patch version increase not adhering to semver. Also, due to the tag v0.0.3 already having been used for [0.0.2], which is confusing. From now on, atft library versions will match Git tags and GitHub releases.\nAdded\n\natft library: exposition of atft's public API by [@makimenko] fixing issue #39\n\n[0.0.2] - 2019-04-10\nAdded\n\natft library by [@makimenko] separating the Three.js bindings from the example code in `app.component.{html|ts|...}\nIt is published on NPM: https://www.npmjs.com/package/atft\n\nChangelog (example project)\nSince the example project is not meant to be used as a dependency, we will always leave it at version [0.0.0].\n[0.0.0]\nInitial and

using simple components:\n\n  \n    \n    \n    \n      \n      \n    \n  \nStorybook\nExplore provided Angular components in isolation!\nClick below to see the demo in a web browser:\n\n\n\nGoals of this repo\n\nImplement npm atft library\nBindings for Three.js\nSceneComponent with basic usage of scene, camera, lights, helpers, renderer\nIntegrated Three.js examples as components (e.g. OrbitControls, OBJLoader, ObjectLoader)\n\n\nDevelop and test library components in isolation via Storybook\n\nUsage in your Angular project\n\nSet up an Angular project and install dependencies:npm i three three.meshline atft --save\n\nImport library into your module:\nimport { AtftModule } from 'atft';\n...\n  imports: [\n    ...\n    AtftModule\n  ]\n ...\nUse atft library components in src/app.app.component.html:\n \n   \n     \n     \n     \n       \n       \n     \n   \n \n(optionally) if you want to fit 3D scene canvas into entire screen (horizontally and vertically):\nin src/styles.css:\n html, body {\n     height: 100%;\n     margin: 0;\n }  in src/app/app.component.css:\n :host {\n     height: 100%;\n     display: flex;\n } \n\nDevelopment\nBuild Library\n\ngit clone https://github.com/makimenko/angular-template-for-threejs.git\nnpm install\nng build atft\n\nRun Tests\n\nnpm test\n\nRun Storybook\nRun and watch locally: npm run storybook\nOur storybook config is in ./storybook and our stories in ./src/stories.\nSee the official Storybook.js documentation for more information.\nAPI Documentation\nFor mode details see API
