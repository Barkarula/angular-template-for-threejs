# Angular Template For Dummies

The goal of this Git repository is to simplify new project development via pre-creation of frequently used Angular project starters.  

# Branches
The repository includes multiple branches and each branch represents set of functionalities.  
Such approach allows to see what has to be changed (using Git branch diffs) in order to make it work. In addition to Git diff, it's possible to use Git patch, cherry pick etc to combine multiple starters into one.

## master
Base project generated by [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli), in addition includes minor fixes like a standard browser polyfills, specific versions etc. Actually there is no benefit to use master branch as starter project (angular-cli can do all this stuff for you). Master branch is committed just to be able to compare other branches vs master.

## [material](https://github.com/makimenko/angular-template-for-dummies/tree/material)
Base project extended by:
- [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io) components
- Offline [Material Icons](https://material.io/icons)
- MaterialDesignModule with pre-exported set of [all available components](https://material.angular.io/components/categories)

See [diffs](https://github.com/makimenko/angular-template-for-dummies/compare/material)

## [threejs](https://github.com/makimenko/angular-template-for-dummies/tree/threejs)
Base project extended by:
- Amazing 3D engine [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) for web applications
- SceneComponent with basic usage of scene, camera, lights, axis helper, raytracer, renderer and collada model
- Enabled possibility to use non-moduled three.js code (eg OrbitControls and ColladaLoader). Some additional info: the things in threejs/examples/js/ haven't been transformed to support modules yet, this makes them currently unusable from within environment such as Angular, more info: [threejs issue #9562](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/issues/9562). But nothing is not possible and sample includes one of working workarounds.

## [universal](https://github.com/makimenko/angular-template-for-dummies/tree/universal)
Base project extended by:
- [Angular Universal](https://github.com/angular/universal) - server side rendering (or pre-rendering) of Angular applications
- [Express Server](https://github.com/expressjs/express) - fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for node.
- As example taken excellent [article](https://medium.com/@evertonrobertoauler/angular-5-universal-with-transfer-state-using-angular-cli-19fe1e1d352c) (excluding Transfer State) with demo code hosted posted on GitHub [universal-demo-v5](https://github.com/evertonrobertoauler/universal-demo-v5) repository

Build and execute express server:
```
npm run build
node dist/server.js
```
